Annie and Jasper Final Project part 1 

To play pictionary:
1. run code
2. follow instructions in terminal (note that to start drawing you must press enter)
3. click on shapes in window and follow instructions in terminal to draw them. 
(Note: don't click on point! It gives an error, we'll fix this in part 2)
5. You can draw up to 5 shapes, we haven't figured out how to make the key presses work (also for part 2)

Note on unit tests:
we did two unit tests (and they passed!)
But we commented it out in main because the rest of main wouldn't run otherwise.
